# How to use

Documentation -> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

1. I added prefix for all tailwind classes (**tw-**)
- Use tw-text-lg instead of "text-lg"
- Use "tw-bg-yellow-500" instead of "bg-yellow-500"

- I added the prefix so we dont confuse tailwind classes with our own custom style

2. Add your classes in html or in input.css

3. run "npm run dev" on the command line in order to compile the style.css

4. READ
- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design
- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode 
- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states (optional)

## Again we are using tailwind because of the breakpoints and darkmode
